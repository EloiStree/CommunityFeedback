# Community Feedback

You want to asks me a question(s) about one of my project. Sent it here:  
https://github.com/EloiStree/CommunityFeedback/issues  

I am generaly a gently and friendly guy: I like to help people.  
So please don't be shy to ask question.  

**Note**:  
I will answers as soon as I have time for that. 
- by an answers or solution if I can;
- by a rediction;
- by a negatif answer if I can't help.

_No need to push if I don't answers, it would just means that I am too busy working on something in real life. 
Or in a mental break for human reason._
